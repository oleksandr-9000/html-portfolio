<h1>The Best Movies According to Oleksandr</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Space Odissey: 2001</h3>
<p>I like the visual aestetic and the plot is thrilling.</p>
<h3>Sout with cabbage</h3>
<p>Fun film. Has it's underlying moral elements, which I like alot.</p>
<h3>Alien</h3>
<p>Again (like in the Space Odissey: 2001) - I like the cluncky retro-futuristic aesthetic, the plot is simple and yet gripping.</p>
